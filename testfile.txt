In the realm of software development, C++ stands out as a powerful and versatile programming language. It offers a rich set of features that enable developers to create high-performance applications. From system software to game development, C++ provides the tools necessary to handle complex tasks efficiently. Its object-oriented nature allows for modular and maintainable code, while its low-level capabilities give programmers fine-grained control over system resources. As a result, C++ remains a popular choice among developers who require both performance and flexibility in their projects.The setw C++ function is used to set the width of the input-output stream. By the width of the input-output stream, we mean the number of characters that the user can output or take input. setw function puts a lower limit on the size of the output stream and an upper limit on the size of the input stream.
